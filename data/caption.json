        "article": "The moves by Facebook and its rivals set up a battle for control over social interactions across the Internet.\n\n\"There is definitely a multiround fight that is going to be happening here,\" said Jeremiah Owyang, a partner at the Altimeter Group, a digital strategy consulting firm.\n\nAnalysts say Facebook's desire to spread its tentacles across the Web could run into privacy hurdles, as it will require the company to share increasing amounts of personal information about its users with other sites.\n\n\"They are going to have to secure more consumers' approval for data-sharing,\" said Augie Ray, an analyst at Forrester Research.\n\nFacebook's strategy, in some ways, follows an approach taken by Google nearly a decade ago. The Internet search engine, after establishing itself as a destination for Internet queries, began syndicating its search box, and later its advertising system, across the Web through toolbars and partnerships. As Facebook becomes an ever more important source of traffic to other Web sites, the two companies' rivalry is certain to sharpen.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on its coming announcements. But people familiar with Facebook's plans say the company will introduce a series of products and technologies to deepen its presence across the Web.\n\nFor instance, Facebook will introduce a universal \"Like\" button that Web publishers will be able to put on their pages. Similar to the Facebook \"Share\" buttons that are already popular with many Web sites, the \"Like\" buttons will make it easier for Web publishers to offer more social experiences, in essence allowing Facebook friends to enjoy those sites together.\n\nWhile \"Share\" buttons allow users to post links that their friends see on their Facebook pages, those links are fleeting. The Like button will allow Facebook to keep a record of what a user linked to, providing the company with ever more data about people's preferences. Facebook, in turn, plans to share that data with Web publishers, so that a magazine Web site, for instance, may be able to show users all the articles that their friends like. A site like Yelp may show reviews from a user's friends, rather than those from strangers.\n\nFacebook is also planning to offer a toolbar that Web sites will be encouraged to place at the bottom of their pages. The toolbar will build on Facebook Connect, a service the company introduced in 2008, allowing people to use their Facebook identities to log into various sites. The toolbar will be easier for publishers to use and may encourage more users to log in. Facebook engineers were still working on the feature, and it was not clear if it would be introduced at the conference.\n\nBut Facebook's toolbar is likely to collide with the efforts of Meebo, whose own toolbar has gained growing acceptance. It allows users to log in to Web sites with their identities from many social services, chat with friends from those services and select pieces of content from a site, like a photo, to share with those friends. The new alliance will establish standards that will allow Meebo, and other similar services, to know easily what networks a user belongs to and give them an option to sign in with their identities from those networks.\n\n\"We'll know which networks and which buttons to put in front of you,\" said Seth Sternberg, chief executive of Meebo. Meebo and its allies, which include Microsoft and Yahoo, plan to hand over the technology to a nonprofit group that will oversee its development.\n\nChris Messina, open Web advocate at Google, said Twitter and Facebook were leading the way among social sites. But he added, \"It is far too soon to write the last chapter in digital identity.\""

If you have an Amazon Prime account, Prime Photos can be a great option, since, like Google Photos, you get free, unlimited storage, which includes the ability to store RAW images, which are those high quality files for photo editing on an image editor. But you need to pay for an Amazon Prime account.\n\nDropbox has long been a popular backup option for many photographers; it is easy to use and works well on many platforms, but you get only two GB of free storage, and additional storage is pricey ($9.99/month or $99/year for one TB).\n\nFor serious photographers who shoot lots of photos, there are additional options: Some shutterbugs splurge for robust photo-organizing software packages, including apps by ACDSee, Mylio and Adobe, which, for a fee, include online cloud storage. In fact, Adobe recently updated its professional photo organizer, Lightroom, and expanded its cloud-storage plans, which are available at various prices.\n\nAs the name implies, external hard drives, which range in price from $50 (one to two TB) to $350 and up (eight TB), are like the storage that's built into your computers, except they're connected externally. Most hook up via a USB connection, although there are other methods. (For instance, network attached storage, or NAS, drives, connect via an Ethernet line to your home or office network.) As with your internal drive, there are many ways to transfer, copy, or sync your photos. You can also automate your backup using your computer's operating system, the external hard-drive's software, or a third-party backup software app or service.\n\nIf you need suggestions for a good external hard drive, Wirecutter, the New York Times product-review site, has a roundup of options at different sizes and price points here.\n\nOur personal library of images generally doesn't end with just our digital photos. Many of us also own precious prints, photo albums, slides and negatives, some of which can be decades old.\n\nTo back them up properly, you'll need to digitize or scan them. There are scanning services available where you can mail or drop off your prints and negatives and get digital versions created for you, although some can be pricey. You can also scan them yourself if you have an all-in-one printer that can scan, or a dedicated scanner. If you're not looking for a high-end scan, though, use Google's PhotoScan mobile app, which lets you use your phone's camera like a scanner to capture photos, even if they're framed and behind glass. (The app is pretty effective at eliminating glare and reflection.) For slides and negatives, though, you'll need to scan them yourself, or have a service process them for you."

After images surfaced of the suspect in the Charleston shootings, a white man named Dylann Roof, posing with the Confederate flag -- and after families of the victims publicly forgave him -- Governor Haley said: Enough. Legislation was swiftly drafted, a law was signed, and this flag of pride was demoted to relic.\n\nAs Mr. Smith watched the flag rolled up and history unfold, he felt chills running along his spine. \"Very moving,\" he nearly whispered.\n\nNow, on a hot Saturday afternoon eight days after that emotional ceremony, Mr. Smith was back at the capitol, only this time in his gray uniform and broad-brimmed campaign hat. A group called the Black Educators for Justice would be rallying in the early afternoon on the north side of the State House. And on the south side, a couple of hours later, the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan would be demonstrating.\n\nIt promised to be a busy day.\n\nMr. Smith watched from the north side's top granite step as black demonstrators vented their frustrations. Then he walked through the blessed cool of the State House to the south side, which faces the back of a statue of Strom Thurmond, the longtime senator and segregationist.\n\nBike-rack barricades had been arrayed to separate the white-supremacist demonstrators from a swelling crowd of people, some fresh from the black-empowerment rally on the north side. \"You could kind of feel the tension in the air,\" Mr. Smith recalled.\n\nSoon the demonstrators, a few dozen, came marching from the west, flanked by Mr. Smith's \"advance civil emergency response team.\" Many wore the black shirts of the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi organization that, according to its website, believes: \"Only those of pure White blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Noncitizens may live in America only as guests and must be subject to laws for aliens. Accordingly, no Jew or homosexual may be a member of the nation.\""

        "article": "KETCHUM, Idaho -- SIXTY years ago this week, as and approached the summit of the world's highest mountain, they were stopped by a 40-foot wall of rock and ice. It was, Hillary later wrote, \"a formidable looking problem ...We realized that at this altitude it might well spell the difference between success and failure.\"\n\nEmploying the skills he had learned in the Alps, Hillary jammed his feet, hands and shoulders into a thin crack between a ridge of ice and the rock and, as he put it, \"levered myself\" up the wall. Then he brought Tenzing up on a tight rope, and together they climbed the final 300 feet to become the first humans to stand on the summit of .\n\nToday, that 40-foot wall is called the Hillary Step. Each May, large numbers of climbers line up to attempt it, causing a lengthy -- and dangerous -- backup. But this past week, it was reported that the Expedition Operators Association, a Nepali organization that manages teams climbing Everest, has proposed a solution to this final obstacle on the standard route to the top: putting a permanent ladder on the Hillary Step.\n\nBetween 1987 and 2009, I went on 11 expeditions to Mount Everest, reaching the top seven times. I've climbed both up and down the Hillary Step six times. I think the ladder is a bad idea. It won't solve the real problem, which is overcrowding on the most famous route in mountaineering. At its best, installing a permanent ladder to surmount the Hillary Step would be like slapping a Band-Aid on an artery that's hemorrhaging.\n\nBecause guided commercial expeditions on Everest have become so popular, scores or even hundreds of clients go for the top on the same day. Each May, the weather forecast pinpoints the optimal dates for a summit thrust. Most of the teams seize that precious window, as a kind of \"group think\" takes hold. That is what causes the overcrowding. And now that fixed ropes are strung by Sherpas up every foot of the South Col route, from base camp at 17,000 feet to the summit at 29,035 feet, a perilous traffic jam inevitably forms on the final ridge. Because of their dependence on the fixed ropes, clients can move no faster than the slowest person in the queue. It's become routine to have to wait two or three hours to tackle the Hillary Step.\n\nEven if a ladder is bolted to the rock on the Hillary Step, it won't alleviate the bottleneck that inevitably develops there on summit day. Climbers will still clip their ascenders (mechanical devices that grip ropes) to the fixed lines that parallel and safeguard the ladder, and because there's no alternative to that narrow passage, the two-to-three hour wait will still impose its treacherous delay. For that matter, wearing goggles, down suits and oxygen masks, mountaineers can hardly see their own feet, so climbing down the ladder promises to be every bit as difficult as rappelling the Step on a fixed line."
